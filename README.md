Email Templates
=======================================

These HTML email templates can be used off the shelf or can provide a starting point for your customized email designs. These are the "start from scratch" MessageMaker&trade; templates you see within your MailerMailer account.

All templates include markup with our template language so that content, images, and styles are editable when uploaded into a MailerMailer account. They also include mail merge tags that allow you to insert dynamic content from your 
MailerMailer account.

For more information on how to build custom email templates, read [our guide](http://www.mailermailer.com/resources/guides/how-to-build-custom-email-templates.rwp).

All templates have been tested and render consistently across all major email clients. If you do find a bug or have a question please contact our Creative Director:
